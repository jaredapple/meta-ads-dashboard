### ❌ Zenagen
- **Account ID**: 773006558299181  
- **Token Status**: ❌ Missing (no access token stored)
- **Last Sync**: 8/20/2025 (outdated)
- **Action Needed**: Re-authenticate and store access token

## Root Cause

Both **Pair of Thieves** and **Zenagen** accounts exist in the database but have **empty access_token fields**. This means:

1. They were initially set up but tokens weren't properly stored
2. Or tokens were stored but got cleared/expired
3. Without valid tokens, the ETL can't access their Meta Ads data

## Resolution Steps

### Option 1: Re-authenticate via Your Application
1. Go to your dashboard account management
2. Re-connect/re-authorize Pair of Thieves and Zenagen
3. Ensure tokens are properly stored in database
4. Run historical data sync

### Option 2: Manual Token Update (if you have valid tokens)
```sql
UPDATE client_accounts 
SET access_token = 'YOUR_VALID_TOKEN_HERE'
WHERE client_name IN ('Pair of Thieves', 'Zenagen');
```

### Option 3: Use Meta Business Manager
1. Generate new access tokens from Meta Business Manager
2. Update tokens in database 
3. Run sync

## After Token Resolution

Once tokens are fixed, run:
```bash
node sync-individual-account.js "Pair of Thieves" 60
node sync-individual-account.js "Zenagen" 60
```

This will backfill 60 days of historical data for proper analytics.

## Prevention

Consider implementing:
- Automatic token refresh mechanism
- Token expiration monitoring  
- Automated re-authentication flows
- Health check alerts for token status
