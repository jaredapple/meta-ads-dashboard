## Troubleshooting

### Current Configuration:
```json
"meta-ads": {
  "command": "/Users/jaredapplebaum/Desktop/Meta MCP/start-mcp.sh"
}
```

### If MCP Server Still Doesn't Connect:
1. **Restart Claude Desktop** completely (Quit and reopen)
2. **Check logs** at: `~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-meta-ads.log`
3. **Verify script permissions**: Ensure start-mcp.sh is executable
4. **Try alternative configs** from `claude-desktop-config-backup.json`

### Debug Information:
The shell script now provides detailed debug output in the Claude Desktop logs:
- Current directory verification
- Node/NPM version checks  
- File existence confirmation
- Environment setup status

### If Queries Don't Work:
- Make sure to ask questions about your Meta ads data specifically
- Try simpler queries first like "How much did I spend on ads yesterday?"
- Check that your .env file is properly configured
